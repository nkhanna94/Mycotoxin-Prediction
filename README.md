# Mycotoxin Prediction using Hyperspectral Imaging

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting mycotoxin (DON) levels in corn using hyperspectral imaging data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment via a Flask API and a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

```

## **Setup Instructions**  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nkhanna94/vomitoxin-prediction.git
   cd vomitoxin-prediction
   ```  

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. **Run the Streamlit App for Predictions**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run deployment/streamlit_app.py
   ```
   
## Model Development
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling, transformation, and outlier handling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Dimensionality reduction and correlation analysis.
- **Modeling:** Random Forest and XGBoost, optimized with Optuna.
- **Evaluation:** RMSE, MAE, RÂ², and interpretability using SHAP.

## Deployment
- **Flask API:** Serves predictions via a RESTful endpoint.
- **Streamlit App:** Interactive UI for users to upload spectral data and get predictions.

## Key Findings  
- **XGBoost outperforms Random Forest** with a higher test RÂ² (0.6756 vs. 0.6502), making it the preferred model.  
- **Residuals follow a bell-shaped curve,** indicating normally distributed errors.  
- **Most actual vs. predicted values** are clustered around zero, with few significant deviations.
